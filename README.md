# Knowledge Evaluation Test - Angular

As an user I would like to have a tool that allows me to create and manage important notes to me.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- I want to create notes
- I want to delete notes
- I want to edit notes
- I want to see all my notes
- I want to see one specific note
- I want a cool layout that works nice on mobile and desktop devices
- I want to change the order of my notes from the newest to the oldest or from A-Z to Z-A 

**Extra Information**

- The user does not know what he wants for layout. So, feel free to be creative and surprise the user with a cool layout.

- Unit tests are **not** required. But having them will be a very good extra.

- You're going to find a template project bellow. The usate of this template is requested. Otherwise your code will not be evaluated.
